# Kickstarter_analysis

Overview of Project
This analysis was intended to provide Louise with information that could help maximize success when starting a fundraising campaign for her theater projects. 

Analysis and Challenges

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This project included 1,369 Theater based kickstarter campaigns launched from 2014 to 2017.  Of the campaigns analyzed, 839 were considered successful due to meeting or exceeding the campaign goal. The analysis found campaigns started in spring or summer months, particularly May or June, were substantially more successful than if they were launched during winter months. In summary, 13-14% of kickstarters were successful if started in May or June, whereas only 4% were successful when launched in December. 

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In order to analyze the success of a campaign based on the financial goals, the project broke the data into eleven brackets of $5,000 increments, with the exception of the first bracket which was a goal of less than $1,000. The project determined goals that start in the $1,000 range to the $10,000 range were most likely to meet that goal. Only 51 percent of campaigns were successful when setting a goal less than $1,000. Campaigns in the $1,000-$4,999 range were successful on average 68 percent of the time. 

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One potential challenge if one were looking at data based on goal outcomes, they would be highly skewed due to outliers in the lower range. This was not an actual challenge because the assignment specifically instructed the 'Outcomes based on Goals' to be reported using the 0-1000 range first, and then reporting in 5000 dollar increments. 

Results
In summary, based on data analyzed in this project, Lousie is most likely to maximize success on her Theater fundraising campaign if she started it in May or June, and set a goal between $1,000 and $10,000 dollars.
